<h2>2.3 - Marginaler, kantlinjer och paddning</h2>
<h4>Even if sharing is caring, you'll probably guard your own safe space and the restrictions around it!</h4>

        The partitioning of a webpage is essential, if you want the flow of photographs on your Tumblr to run
        smoothly you have to decide the size, edges and padding to each object. For example, you do not want all the
        pictures to blend into one picture, therefore a padding (a decided amount of pixels or percent of the webpage)
        as a safe space to each element is added so when the next picture is added the picture will be added with the
        spacing you have decided is enough.

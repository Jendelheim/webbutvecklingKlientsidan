    <h3>The article-tag and how to use it properly!</h3>
    <p> An article is supposed to be selfconstrained i.e if you select just the article from a webpage, <br>
        the article should make sense by itself and don't need external information, data och explanation. <br>
        <br>
        And some of the common areas where we see HTML5 articles is; news story, blogposts or forumposts.
    </p>

<article>
    <h3> And what is there else to learn about HTML5? </h3>
    <p>
        I've created a navbar here where you can pick which next subject you want to learn more about! <br>
        Just press the option you want to learn more about and you will be redirected to the related webpage.

<h4>The power of a the aside-tag!</h4>
<p>It is not to rare that you read an article for example, and it contains a word or theory for example <br>
    which needs further explanation. So if I would tell you that the Zlatanism was created in the early 2000s.
    <br><br>
    This is one possible implementation of the &ltaside&gt-tag!

</p>

<aside>
    <h4>Zlatanism</h4>
    <p>Zlatanism is the word used to summarize the more dedicated fans of Zlatan Ibrahimovic which follows <br>
    him as a individual player and not because which he plays team for or which nation.</p>

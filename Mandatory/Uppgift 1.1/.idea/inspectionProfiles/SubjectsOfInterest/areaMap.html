<h3>Description of : area and map</h3>

<p> Who has'nt played the boardgame Operation where you are supposed to perform different surgeries. <br>
    An imagemap is a picture or some kind of designated area on the webpage which has clickable areas within it. <br>
    <br>
    An example could be that if we would like to create a online version of the game one way would be by adding the board <br>
    as a image, making it a usemap and adding areas (different parts of the body) where different operations could be performed.
</p>

<h3>Example: </h3>

<img src="../../Pictures/operation.jpg" width="500" height="500" usemap="#operationMap">

<map name="operationMap">
    <area shape="rect" coords=" 300,415,250,350" alt="heart" href="../../Pictures/heart.jpg" >


</map>

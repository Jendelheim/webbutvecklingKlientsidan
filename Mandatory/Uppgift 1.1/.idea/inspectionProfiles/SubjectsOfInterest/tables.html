<h3>Description of : tables </h3>

<p> When users are creating content online, one of the common ways to present data or content is by using a table. <br>
    We are used to seeing tables in our daily life, for example every time you've used Excel / Google Docs for a task or <br>
    when you are buying a new phone and tries to select which paymentplan you would like to choose it is most often written in a table.
</p>

<h3>Example: </h3>

<img src="../../Pictures/tables.png">

<p> Tables are divided in two different categories of content, you have the tablerow which defines the amount of rows used <br>
    in the table and is declared by a &lttr&gt-tag. The second tag which is the tabledata-tag is declared by a &lttd&gt-tag, <br>
    which adds the data (i.e content) to the related (parent) tablerow-tag (tr). </p>

<p> Now when you know what the rows and data comes from, I'll briefly introduce you to two other tags. The th-tag and caption-tag. <br>
    You might know what the rows / columns represent, but if you show your table to another person it might not be as obvious. <br>
    by using a &ltth&gt-tag you get a bold text which is stating the name of that certain column, for example if you want to <br>
    in column A list on each row the names of players in a football team, and column B list the amount of goals they've made this season.
    <br>
    And as far as we know, this table could be absolutely useless since the value of a player (i.e Zlatan) and a random number <br>
    might not mean anything if you do not know the table is just a representation of the amount of goals per player this season. <br>
    One way to tell the user what the table is all about, the &ltcaption&gt-tag is a legit way to do it.

</p>

<h3> An example of the table from above : </h3>

<table>
    <caption>Amount of goals per player current season</caption>
    <tr>
        <th>Player</th>
        <th>Goals</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Zlatan</td>
        <td>25</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Cavani</td>
        <td>13</td>
    </tr>

</table>

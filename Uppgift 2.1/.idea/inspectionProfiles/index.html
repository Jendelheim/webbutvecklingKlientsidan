<h4>Cascading Style Sheets 444</h4>

<div id="first_explaination">
    <p>
        When editing a webpage the content is often divided in different sections with different purposes.
        For example, just above this paragraph two different headers are used, a h2 (second biggest header)
        aswell as a h4 (a slightly smaller header, used here as a subheader). What if you would like to change the
        headers colors, earlier, before CSS was implemented the developer had to enter the decided color in in every
        html-file the header were included. Now with CSS, it is possible to change the property in one place and all
        related headers will change their color.

        But what if you would like to change all the elements of the same character within one document ? is that even
        possible and what would be the purpose? With CSS, we can change all the elements as long as we identify it
        correctly, for example all paragraphs in this document have been selected to change font-style to Arial aswell
        as all div's have got the property to be 50% of the browsers window and a lightgrey background-color.

    </p>

        An example where it could be useful to have different properties regarding the design is wether the user
        is visiting your website as a company or a private person. The content, the general design aswell as the objects
        retreived from databases and such might be the same but perhaps you want the color to be lightblue if the user
        is a private person or switch to a lighter red if the user is a company.

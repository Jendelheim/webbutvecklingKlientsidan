<h3>Description of: pictures </h3>

<p> Internet is a fun place, it was originally created to post funny pictures of cats but has evolved to something <br>
    much more serious and is now full of funny pictures of all different animals you can imagine. <br>
    <br>
    To post a funny picture of a cat you use the &ltimg&gt-tag where you can type wether you would like to add some <br> 
    information such as a identifier (ID), name or class. Aswell as you have to enter the URL for the picture.

</p>

<h3>Example picture: </h3>

<img id="funnyCat" class="picture" src="../../Pictures/funnyCat.png">

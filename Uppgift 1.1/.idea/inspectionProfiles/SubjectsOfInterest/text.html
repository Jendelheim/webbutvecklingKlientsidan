<h3>Description of : text</h3>

<p>When discussing different types of textoptions in HTML there is quite a few different options to use. <br>
    For example if you want to provide a header to your webpage with related subheaders as in Microsoft Word <br>
    you can use the header-tags (i.e &lth1&gt, &lth2&gt, &lth3&gt etc).

    <br><br>

    When you are done with your headers you can start typing the actual text you want on your webpage. <br>
    Two different ways of entering text on your webpage is either a normal paragraph which is used by the &ltp&gt-tag. <br>
    When you have posted some paragraphs and you need to cite a scientific paper for example the blockquote is a suitable option. <br>

<p> Example of a blockquote: </p>

<blockquote>
This is an example of a blockquote where you can cite the work you would like to include within your webpage <br>
    but still be clear that it is a cite and nothing that you are the author of. It is displayed on your website by <br>
    "tabbing" once and letting your paragraph be a bit more aligned to the right then normal paragraphs.

<h3>Description of : lists  </h3>

    <p> Wether you like it or not, sometimes you have to keep track of things so you do not forget them. <br>
        A perfect way of remembering stuff to do is writing them down in a list. If the things you post on your list <br>
        are ordered in a specific, just stacked to remember or bulletpoints of some kind there are lists in HTML prepared for this.
        <br><br>
        In the following examples I will show a description list, an ordered list aswell as an unordered list.
